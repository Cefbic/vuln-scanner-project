# vuln-scanner-project
This project was a part of my Master's degree in Cybersecurity. It focuses on vulnerability assessment using an open-source GitHub vulnerability scanner, which was modified and tested in a controlled lab environment.

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to:
- Customize and enhance an open-source vulnerability scanner
- Deploy a vulnerable web application on for testing
- Run scans to detect vulnerabilities and generate detailed reports
- Analyze risk severity and recommend mitigations

## ðŸ“¸ Setup
the process of cloning the DVWA repository from GitHub into the /var/www/html directory using git clone. After the cloning, I navigated into the DVWA directory and attempted to copy the configuration file using sudo

I viewed the contents of the config.inc.php file using cat. The file contains configuration variables for connecting DVWA to MariaDB) database, including server,database name,username, and password.

Here, the MariaDB service is started using sudo service mariadb start. This is an essential
step to ensure the web application can communicate with the database

The MariaDB CLI was accessed with root privileges. I created the DVWA database with the appropriate privileges and access credentials defined in the earlier config file.
